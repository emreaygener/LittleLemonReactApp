# Little Lemon Web App

## Introduction

Welcome to Little Lemon, a React-based web application developed as a capstone project for the Front-End Developer Certificate program. This project showcases the culmination of various skills and technologies learned throughout the program, focusing on building a functional and user-friendly restaurant booking system.

## Project Description

Little Lemon is a web application designed for a fictional restaurant, providing a seamless and interactive user experience for booking tables. The app consists of three main components: a Home page, a Booking form, and a Reservations page. Each component is crafted with careful attention to UX/UI design principles, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Features

- Home Page: A welcoming interface introducing users to Little Lemon, complete with essential information about the restaurant.
- Booking Form: A user-friendly form allowing customers to book tables at the restaurant. The form includes client-side validation to ensure accurate data entry and prevent double bookings.
- Reservations Page: A dedicated page displaying existing reservations, providing users with a clear view of their bookings.
- Form Validations: Implemented to enhance data accuracy and user experience by preventing erroneous inputs.
- Unit Testing: Ensuring the app's reliability and functionality through rigorous unit tests.
- Responsive Design: Designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal performance across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the dynamic user interface.
- Figma: For designing the UI/UX components and creating wireframes.
- CSS Grid: For creating a flexible and responsive layout.
- Semantic HTML: For structuring the app's content meaningfully.
- Git & GitHub: For version control and project management.
- API Integration: For handling booking data and ensuring persistent information.
- Unit Testing: For maintaining code quality and functionality.

## Development Process

- Setup and Planning: Setting up the development environment, tracking the project with Git, and designing the UI in Figma.
- HTML & CSS: Establishing the app's HTML structure and styling using reusable CSS components.
- Component Development: Building React components for the home page, booking form, and reservations page.
- Functionality Implementation: Coding the booking system, managing state, and integrating APIs for data handling.
- Testing and Refinement: Adding unit tests, refining the UI/UX based on feedback, and ensuring accessibility.

## Conclusion

Little Lemon is a testament to the practical application of front-end development skills acquired during the certificate program. It serves as a job-ready portfolio piece, demonstrating proficiency in React, UX/UI design, and web development best practices. This project not only highlights technical abilities but also reflects a commitment to delivering high-quality and user-centric web applications.
